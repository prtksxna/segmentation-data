Perform fast and numerically stable statistical analysis using **`wink-statistics`**. It is a part of [wink](http://winkjs.org/) â€” a growing family of high quality packages for Statistical Analysis, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning in NodeJS.

Summarize, Discover and Analyze data with it's rich set of features:

1. Analyze both continuous and categorical data.

2. Handles real-time stream of data and incrementally compute required statistic that usually would take more than one pass over the data as in **standard deviation** or **simple linear regression**.

3. Minimizes data preprocessing by handling array of data structures containing numerical values, e.g. array of objects.
